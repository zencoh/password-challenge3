# Password Schmassword
This is challenge 3 for my bootcamp

## Description 
This is a password generator I made using javascript. The HTML and CSS was given in the starter code. This project can be used when a user needs a new strong password for a website or subscription or application that requires a password. By prompting the user to select if they want lower case, upper case, numbers, or/and special characters makes this password generator more accessible for more users. I learned how to use functions, if then statements along with if else statements, and how to create a for loop. I also had to use outside reasearch such as using w3schools, wdn web docs, and a couple youtube videos, and using outside resources is what a full stack developer would have to do on the job. So I thought that this project really made me stretch my knowledge and help me learn a lot when it comes to JavaScript. My project stands out because I had such a hard time getting it to work properly that I rewrote the whole script and tried to simplify everything where I could, which resulted in my code being easy to read for other programers.

## Usage
To create a new password click "generate password", then you will be prompted with how long to make the password, next you will be prompted about which types of characters to include, and finally your password will generate in the box above the "generate password" button.
